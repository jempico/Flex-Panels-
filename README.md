Project 3/30 from WesBos JavaScript30 challenge, consisting on building 30 things in 30 days with pure JavaScript.

Things I've learned while doing it:

1. How to create a grid with nested Flex Panels.
2. How to toggle a class name.
3. How to use the 'transform: translateY' CSS atribute to hide some element from the viewport and then show it again.
4. Kept practicing with CSS transitions to animate the elements of the grid.
